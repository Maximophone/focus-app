We will start building an android app to help myself be more productive. The initial focus will be to control which apps I can open on my phone at what time. But I want to build this gradually.

I think the first step will be something minimal, a control panel where I can turn or on off access to all the apps I have on my phone. I want to really nail down this core mechanic before we do anything else.

Also, it will be important to setup the basics well. How we compile the app, how we test it, how we deploy it easily to my phone, etc.
